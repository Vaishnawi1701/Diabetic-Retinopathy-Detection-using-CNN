# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection-using-CNN
Deep learning-based project for detecting Diabetic Retinopathy from retinal fundus images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model classifies disease stages from normal to severe, aiding early diagnosis and treatment. Implemented with Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and image preprocessing techniques.
